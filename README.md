# aerogear-ios-http  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-ios-http.png)](https://travis-ci.org/aerogear/aerogear-ios-http)
Thin layer to take care of your http requests working with NSURLSession. 
Taking care of: 

* Json serializer,
* Multipart upload, 
* Pluggable object serialization.

100% Swift.

## Example Usage

This example is extracted from AeroGearSample.playground
```swift
var url = "http://api.icndb.com/jokes"
var http = Session(url: url, sessionConfig: NSURLSessionConfiguration.defaultSessionConfiguration())
http.GET(success: {(response: AnyObject?) in
    if let unwrappedResponse = response as? Dictionary<String, AnyObject> {
        println("Success: \(unwrappedResponse)")
    }
    }, failure: {(error: NSError) in
        println("Error")
})// log error
})
```

## Build, test and play with aerogear-ios-http

1. Clone this project

2. Get the dependencies

The project uses [aerogear-ios-httpstub](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-httpstub) framework for stubbing its http network requests. Before running the tests, ensure that a copy is added in your project using `git submodule`. On the root directory of the project run:

```bash
git submodule init && git submodule update
```

3. open AeroGearHttp.xcworkspace

4. Build and run test AGURLSessionStubs target on iPhone5s (64bits) target

5. Build and run test AeroGearHttp target on iPhone5s (64bits) target

6. If you want to give it a trial check AeroGearSample.playground

## Adding the library to your project 

Follow these steps to add the library in your Swift project.

1. [Clone this repository](#1-clone-this-repository)
2. [Add `AeroGearHttp.xcodeproj` to your application target](#2-add-aerogearhttp-xcodeproj-to-your-application-target)
3. Start writing your app!

> **NOTE:** Hopefully in the future and as the Swift language and tools around it mature, more straightforward distribution mechanisms will be employed using e.g [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) and framework builds. Currently neither cocoapods nor binary framework builds support Swift. For more information, consult this [mail thread](http://aerogear-dev.1069024.n5.nabble.com/aerogear-dev-Swift-Frameworks-Static-libs-and-Cocoapods-td8456.html) that describes the current situation.

### 1. Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:aerogear/aerogear-ios-http.git
```

### 2. Add `AeroGearHttp.xcodeproj` to your application target

Right-click on the group containing your application target and select `Add Files To YourApp`
Next, select `AeroGearHttp.xcodeproj`, which you downloaded in step 1.

### 3. Start writing your app!
